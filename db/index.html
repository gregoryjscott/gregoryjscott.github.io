    <p>Firebase’s Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted, NoSQL JSON data store that lets you build rich, collaborative applications by syncing data in milliseconds across all connected clients. Data is stored as a single, hierarchical JSON tree and updated in real time—any changes made by one client are immediately pushed to every other. SDKs for iOS, Android and web handle offline caching and automatic resynchronization, while granular security rules and Firebase Authentication ensure data is accessed and modified only by authorized users. With built-in scalability, sharding and integration with other Firebase services (Cloud Functions, Analytics, etc.), the Realtime Database simplifies the creation of responsive, data-driven apps without the need to manage your own backend.</p>
