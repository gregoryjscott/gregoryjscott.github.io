    <p>The Hypertext Application Language (HAL) is a simple, vendor-neutral media type for representing resources and their relationships in JSON or XML, designed to make RESTful APIs more discoverable and self-descriptive. In HAL, each resource’s state is represented by its attributes, its hyperlinks by a standardized “_links” section (allowing clients to navigate between related resources), and any embedded sub‐resources by an “_embedded” section. By providing a consistent convention for linking and embedding, HAL enables clients to follow HATEOAS principles—dynamically discovering available operations and transitions—without relying on out-of-band documentation.</p>

Developers push code to Heroku via Git or GitHub, and Heroku’s buildpacks automatically detect the language (such as Ruby, Node.js, Python, Java, Go or PHP), install dependencies and compile a runnable slug. Applications run in lightweight, isolated containers called dynos, which can be scaled horizontally or vertically on demand. The platform also offers a marketplace of add-ons (databases, caching, monitoring, logging, etc.), a web-based dashboard and a command-line interface, allowing teams to iterate quickly without managing underlying infrastructure.</p>

    <p>Jekyll is an open-source, Ruby-based static site generator that transforms plain-text content (written in Markdown, Textile or HTML) and Liquid-templated layouts into a complete, static website. By using simple “front matter” at the top of each page or post to define metadata (like title, date and categories), Jekyll assembles content with shared layouts, includes and assets into fully rendered HTML files. Because it produces only static pages—no databases or server-side processing—it delivers fast, secure sites that are easy to host (notably on GitHub Pages) and maintain via version control.</p>

    <p>React Native is an open-source framework developed by Facebook that enables developers to build mobile apps for iOS and Android using JavaScript and React. Instead of rendering web views, React Native translates UI components into native platform widgets, delivering near-native performance and look-and-feel. Its component-based architecture and one-way data flow mirror React for the web, making it easy for JavaScript developers to pick up. Features like hot reloading accelerate the development cycle by instantly reflecting code changes on the device. A rich ecosystem of libraries and a large community contribute reusable modules and plugins, simplifying access to native device features (camera, geolocation, sensors) without writing platform-specific code. By sharing logic and UI components across platforms, React Native significantly reduces development time and maintenance overhead compared to traditional native app development.</p>
