  </h3>

  
</header>

  
    <p>C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie. It is a low-level language, meaning it can be used to control hardware and memory, and is often used for system programming. C is a compiled language, meaning that it is converted into machine code before being executed. It is also a structured language, meaning that it is organized into functions, which can be called from other parts of the program. C is widely used in many applications, including operating systems, embedded systems, and scientific computing.</p>

    <p>C++ is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1985. It is an extension of the C language and provides features such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, and exception handling. C++ is used to develop a wide range of applications, from system software to high-performance server and client applications, and is one of the most popular programming languages in the world.</p>

    <p>FORTRAN (Formula Translator) is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative programming language that is especially suited to numeric computation and scientific computing. It is a compiled language, meaning that it is processed by a compiler program before being run on a computer. It is one of the oldest programming languages and is still used today for a variety of applications. It is known for its efficiency and accuracy in numerical calculations, and is often used in scientific and engineering applications.</p>

</header>

  
    <p>Pascal is a procedural programming language developed in the late 1960s by Niklaus Wirth. It is a high-level language, meaning it is designed to be easier to read and write than low-level languages like assembly. Pascal is a strongly typed language, meaning that all variables must be declared with a specific type before they can be used. It is also a structured language, meaning that programs are broken down into smaller, manageable parts. Pascal is widely used in education and is the basis for many other languages, such as Object Pascal and Delphi.</p>

  </h3>

  
</header>

  
    <p>TI-BASIC is the built-in, interpreted programming language used on Texas Instruments graphing calculators. It features a token‐based syntax resembling BASIC, with commands for arithmetic, control structures (If/Then, For, While), list and matrix operations, and direct access to the calculator’s display, menus, and graphing features. Although it’s easy to learn and deploy—making it popular among students for custom routines and games—its execution speed and memory are limited compared to compiled or desktop languages, so programmers often optimize code by minimizing loops, using built-in functions, or writing critical routines in assembly.</p>

    <p>Visual Basic is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It is used to create Windows applications, web applications, and other software. Visual Basic is a powerful language that allows developers to quickly create applications with a graphical user interface (GUI). It is easy to learn and use, and provides a wide range of features and capabilities. Visual Basic is also compatible with other programming languages, such as C# and Java.</p>

    <p>AIX (Advanced Interactive eXecutive) is an IBM proprietary Unix-based operating system designed for enterprise-level computing. It is a robust, secure, and reliable operating system that provides a high level of scalability and performance. AIX is designed to run on IBM's Power Systems hardware and is optimized for virtualization. It includes a wide range of features such as high availability, scalability, and security. AIX also provides a wide range of tools and utilities for system administration, application development, and system management.</p>

    <p>MS-DOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System) is an operating system developed by Microsoft for IBM-compatible personal computers. It was the most commonly used member of the DOS family of operating systems and was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s and the early 1990s. MS-DOS was designed to provide a user-friendly environment for running programs, managing files, and controlling peripheral devices such as printers and disk drives. It also provided a command-line interface for users to interact with the system. MS-DOS was eventually replaced by Windows 95 and later versions of Windows.</p>
