    <p class="subtitle">Dynamic Curriculum Generation with AI</p>
  
</header>



  <article class="content"><p>This project began as a proof of concept to validate the use of AI for generating dynamic language-learning exercises. While the initial version was built with Swift, I transitioned to React Native to support a wider range of platforms.</p>

<p>In 2024, the project evolved from a personal tool into a formal research initiative. In collaboration with my fiancée, the app was rebuilt for a master’s degree capstone study on the effectiveness of microlearning for adult Spanish learners. This research version is available in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nuggets-language-learning/id6477367353">App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=education.futuristic.nuggets">Play Store</a>.</p>

<p>More recently, we added English lessons to help learners study for the U.S. Naturalization Test and obtain their citizenship. This marks the first step in the app’s next evolution: using AI to create a truly personalized learning journey. The upcoming version generates a curriculum tailored to each learner’s unique goals and interests, continuously assesses fluency, and adapts to their progress.</p>

<h2 id="key-takeaway">Key Takeaway</h2>

<p>Every application contains a state machine—either an explicit, well-defined one, or an ad hoc, implicit one scattered across the codebase.</p>

<p>My initial choice for state management, Zustand, worked well for managing state but offered no structure for organizing event logic and business rules. Adopting XState allowed me to model all application logic as finite state machines. This approach has completely changed how I build apps.</p>

</header>

  
    <p>React Native is an open-source framework developed by Facebook that enables developers to build cross-platform apps using JavaScript and React. Instead of rendering web views, React Native translates UI components into native platform widgets, delivering near-native performance and look-and-feel. Its component-based architecture and one-way data flow mirror React for the web, making it easy for JavaScript developers to pick up. Features like hot reloading accelerate the development cycle by instantly reflecting code changes on the device. A rich ecosystem of libraries and a large community contribute reusable modules and plugins, simplifying access to native device features (camera, geolocation, sensors) without writing platform-specific code. By sharing logic and UI components across platforms, React Native significantly reduces development time and maintenance overhead compared to traditional native app development.</p>
