    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.</p>

    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language used to create webpages and web applications. It is the standard markup language used to create webpages and web applications. HTML is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets. These tags describe the content and structure of webpages and web applications. HTML also provides a means to create interactive webpages and web applications with the use of HTML forms, which can be used to collect user input.</p>

    <p>Ruby is an open-source, object-oriented programming language created by Yukihiro Matsumoto in 1995. It is designed to be simple and easy to use, yet powerful and flexible. Ruby is often used for web development, scripting, and general-purpose programming. It is known for its use of blocks, which allow for the creation of concise and powerful code. Ruby is also popular for its use of metaprogramming, which allows for the dynamic creation of code at runtime.</p>

  </h3>

  
</header>

  
    <p>Typescript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It adds optional static typing to the language, allowing developers to use type annotations to catch errors early in the development process. It also provides features such as classes, modules, and interfaces that are not available in JavaScript. Typescript is designed to make it easier to write and maintain large-scale applications.</p>

      <a href="/tools/hal/">HAL</a>
    
  </h3>

  
</header>

  
    <p>The Hypertext Application Language (HAL) is a simple, vendor-neutral media type for representing resources and their relationships in JSON or XML, designed to make RESTful APIs more discoverable and self-descriptive. In HAL, each resource’s state is represented by its attributes, its hyperlinks by a standardized “_links” section (allowing clients to navigate between related resources), and any embedded sub‐resources by an “_embedded” section. By providing a consistent convention for linking and embedding, HAL enables clients to follow HATEOAS principles—dynamically discovering available operations and transitions—without relying on out-of-band documentation.</p>

      <a href="/tools/jekyll/">Jekyll</a>
    
  </h3>

  
</header>

  
    <p>Jekyll is an open-source, Ruby-based static site generator that transforms plain-text content (written in Markdown, Textile or HTML) and Liquid-templated layouts into a complete, static website. By using simple “front matter” at the top of each page or post to define metadata (like title, date and categories), Jekyll assembles content with shared layouts, includes and assets into fully rendered HTML files. Because it produces only static pages—no databases or server-side processing—it delivers fast, secure sites that are easy to host (notably on GitHub Pages) and maintain via version control.</p>

    <p>macOS is Apple’s Unix‐based desktop operating system, first released in 2001 as Mac OS X and built on the open‐source Darwin core and the proprietary XNU kernel. Designed exclusively for Mac computers, it combines a polished Aqua graphical interface with deep integration of hardware and software, offering features like Spotlight search, Time Machine backups, and Continuity for seamless work across Apple devices. With strong emphasis on stability, security and performance, macOS supports a rich ecosystem of native and third-party applications via the Mac App Store and developer tools such as Xcode, making it a popular choice for both creative professionals and everyday users.</p>
