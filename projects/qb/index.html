    <p class="subtitle">Invoicing $1 Billion/Month for Oil Pipeline</p>
  
</header>



  <article class="content"><p>In 2010, I was tasked with leading the replacement of the Quality Bank for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS), the critical accounting system responsible for invoicing close to a billion dollars of crude oil each month. The system’s core challenge was its volatility. Due to constant litigation, the complex formulas for calculating oil quality were frequently changed retroactively, requiring months or even years of past invoices to be reissued with interest. The legacy system wasn’t designed for this reality; it was a brittle application riddled with one-off patches, requiring developer intervention for every court-ordered revision.</p>

<p>Our solution was to re-architect the system around a new philosophy: business rules should be treated as versioned data, not as static code. We designed a sophisticated database-centric system where every variable affecting the calculations (from quality factors to pipeline configurations) could be versioned. This empowered the client’s team of accountants and lawyers to manage revisions independently by creating new versions of the underlying datasets, without writing a single line of code. To ensure the perfect accuracy required for a high-stakes financial system, the architecture was backed by a rigorous, test-driven development process.</p>

<p>The result was a transformative success. The new Quality Bank became the single source of truth, giving the client the autonomy and confidence to manage their own revisions. As a final validation, we re-ran every invoice from the system’s history, matching the legacy output to the penny.</p>

<h2 id="key-takeaway">Key Takeaway</h2>

<p>A great team can build the impossible. For this project, that meant more than just technical skill; it was a combination of a disciplined, test-driven development process and a truly collaborative partnership with a client who was as committed to the outcome as we were.</p>

    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.</p>

    <p>Backbone.js is a lightweight JavaScript library that brings structure to client‐side applications by providing models with key–value binding and custom events, collections with rich enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and a router for managing application state and URLs. It syncs seamlessly with RESTful APIs via its built‐in sync method, making it easy to fetch and persist JSON data. By relying only on Underscore.js (and optionally jQuery or Zepto), Backbone.js imposes minimal constraints on how you architect your code while offering just enough conventions to keep large‐scale single‐page applications organized and maintainable. Its event‐driven design encourages decoupled components, and its simplicity has made it popular for developers who prefer to assemble their own toolchains rather than adopt more opinionated frameworks.</p>
