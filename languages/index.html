    <p>Typescript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It adds optional static typing to the language, allowing developers to use type annotations to catch errors early in the development process. It also provides features such as classes, modules, and interfaces that are not available in JavaScript. Typescript is designed to make it easier to write and maintain large-scale applications.</p>

    <p>Ruby is an open-source, object-oriented programming language created by Yukihiro Matsumoto in 1995. It is designed to be simple and easy to use, yet powerful and flexible. Ruby is often used for web development, scripting, and general-purpose programming. It is known for its use of blocks, which allow for the creation of concise and powerful code. Ruby is also popular for its use of metaprogramming, which allows for the dynamic creation of code at runtime.</p>

    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.</p>

    <p>SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS). It is used to perform tasks such as retrieving, updating, inserting, and deleting data from a database. SQL is also used to create and modify database structures, such as tables, views, and stored procedures. It is a powerful language that can be used to query, analyze, and manipulate data.</p>

    <p>C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie. It is a low-level language, meaning it can be used to control hardware and memory, and is often used for system programming. C is a compiled language, meaning that it is converted into machine code before being executed. It is also a structured language, meaning that it is organized into functions, which can be called from other parts of the program. C is widely used in many applications, including operating systems, embedded systems, and scientific computing.</p>

    <p>Pascal is a procedural programming language developed in the late 1960s by Niklaus Wirth. It is a high-level language, meaning it is designed to be easier to read and write than low-level languages like assembly. Pascal is a strongly typed language, meaning that all variables must be declared with a specific type before they can be used. It is also a structured language, meaning that programs are broken down into smaller, manageable parts. Pascal is widely used in education and is the basis for many other languages, such as Object Pascal and Delphi.</p>

    <p>TI-BASIC is the built-in, interpreted programming language used on Texas Instruments graphing calculators. It features a token‐based syntax resembling BASIC, with commands for arithmetic, control structures (If/Then, For, While), list and matrix operations, and direct access to the calculator’s display, menus, and graphing features. Although it’s easy to learn and deploy—making it popular among students for custom routines and games—its execution speed and memory are limited compared to compiled or desktop languages, so programmers often optimize code by minimizing loops, using built-in functions, or writing critical routines in assembly.</p>
