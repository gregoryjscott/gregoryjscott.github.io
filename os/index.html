    <p>MS-DOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System) is an operating system developed by Microsoft for IBM-compatible personal computers. It was the most commonly used member of the DOS family of operating systems and was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s and the early 1990s. MS-DOS was designed to provide a user-friendly environment for running programs, managing files, and controlling peripheral devices such as printers and disk drives. It also provided a command-line interface for users to interact with the system. MS-DOS was eventually replaced by Windows 95 and later versions of Windows.</p>
